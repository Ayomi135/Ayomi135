I am a student at the University of the District of Columbia. Iâ€™m a computer science major (CGPA of 3.9). 
I have worked as a tutor for 3 years where I thought students mathematics and computer science helping them prepare for their exams. 
I am very fluent in python and Java and have worked with professors on multiple projects. I am bilingual and a team player. 
I participated in the 2022 AmazonNext Scholar program. I am also a volunteer for the Excellence in Computing and Information Technology Education Program (ExCite program) 
where we educate high school students about the programming language and Robotics where we use the Edison robots.
